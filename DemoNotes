Dev: Build Ad-hoc as debug with sysmbols distribute to dev team only.
Feature A: Include a new AppCenter SDK feature and gets pushed to dev. 


Questions 
1. How to view or run builds for simulators.
2. How to use release to deploy differnt paths.

Speaking Comments
AppCenter Description:
The simplist exaplanation I can give about AppCenter is that it is a group of services that when combine together 
can be use for a complete mobile DevOps solution.  Everything from build, test, monitor, analysis and distribute modern mobile apps.
This includes support for everything from Xamarin, Swift, Object-C, Java, UWP and MacOS.  That's write almost anything you want to write your code AppCenter supports it.

Now What are the benefit of AppCenter.
1. 0-60 Build, Test and Distribution Configuration
2. Cloud Testing Devices
3. Monitor's App Health, Crashes, Events
4. Helps deploy to AppStore'

VSTS Description:
VSTS powerRelease Managment pipeline, build complex releases.
1. Custom Host Build
2. Save build Configuration and reuse.
3. Secure Files -KeyVault
    3.1 Show how to create secure files and secure variable
4. Scheduling builds 


Demo Steps
AppCenter Demo 
1. Create a App in App AppCenter
2. Point to a GitHub repo
3. Setup up a basic build 
4. Setup a basic Distribution
5. Setup a basic cloud test(optional)

AppCenter Branches
1. Create a dev branch and configure it to build for cloud test on one device.
2. Create a qa branch and configure it to run on multiple cloud devices.
3. Configure a master branch to build for AppStore. 

Comments Talk about the though differnces between each approach and how is really about what's your DevOps process.

VSTS Demo
1. Create a Basic Bulid Definition
    1.1 For iOS
    1.2 For Droid
2. Talk about Custom Host build vs Cloud Hosted Builds
3. Kick of a build
4. Setup Basic release Definition
    4.1 Talk about why you would create your own release definition.  This is all about fine tuning your CD proess inside your DevOps process. 
    We are still using AppCenter services for distribution and testing but from the point of custom pipeline/automation.  This is where
    you would deploy other Azure assest, such as App Services, Database deployment, etc.
    4.2 Show the numebers of task available from the market place.
